# Spring-Boot-CRUD-Application-Web-With-Thymeleaf

The application consists of an employee CRUD where it would be allowed to add an employee and a breakfast, developed in Java in conjunction with Spring.
The CPF was used as the primary key, so it cannot be changed. To change the CPF, you must delete the employee and add again.

The simple application can be accessed through the link: [Application](https://unidac-challenge.herokuapp.com/)
